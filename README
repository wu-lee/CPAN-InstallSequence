    CPAN::InstallSequence - Given a module name, generates an ordered list
    of prerequisites to install

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::InstallSequence;

        # Get a list of CPAN distribution names required to install
        # Some::Module on this system, in the order they need to be
        # installed to respect their prerequisites. Any prerequisites
        # which are already installed at the minimum required version or
        # better will not be listed.
        my @deps = CPAN::InstallSequence::finddeps(
            'Some::Module',
            %options
        );

        # The elements returned are simple hashrefs, with author,
        # distribution name, and the minimim version required
        # (which in the case of uninstalled modules, will be the most
        # recent version on CPAN).
        printf "%s-%s-%s\n", @$_{'author','name','version'}
            for @deps;
