I've been using dh-make-perl to package CPAN distributions as Debian
packages, and although it works well for a single package, I was
mildly frustrated by the inability to follow dependencies.  So, I've
written some code to generate a Perl module install sequence using
CPANPLUS, and a wrapper for dh-make-perl.  It's very very early days,
but it will now find and go and build a list of dependencies, given a
Perl module name, and build them into Debian packages using
dh-make-perl.
